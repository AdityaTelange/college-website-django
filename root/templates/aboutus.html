    A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a
    degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution
    offering vocational education, or a secondary school.

    In the United States, "college" may refer to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding tertiary
    educational institution, but generally "college" and "university" are used interchangeably,[1] whereas in the United
    Kingdom, Oceania, South Asia, Southern Africa, most of Europe and Africa, and Canada, "college" may refer to a
    secondary or high school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a
    higher education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a
    constituent part of a university (See this comparison of British and American English educational terminology for
    further information).
